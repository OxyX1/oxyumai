# wasmer.toml (This is a GUESS - check Wasmer.io documentation!)

[package]
name = "OxyX1/oxyumai" # Or however Wasmer names packages
version = "1.0.0" # Should match package.json
description = "AI Code Assistant WebApp"

[[module]]
name = "app" # Or "web", "server"
source = "." # Indicates the current directory
# For Node.js, you often specify a command or use a pre-built container image

# Option A: If Wasmer has direct Node.js support via commands
[commands]
  # This tells Wasmer how to start your application
  start = "npm run start" # or "node index.js"

# Option B: If Wasmer uses a base image + your code (like Docker)
# This section would be very specific to Wasmer's containerized deployment for Node.js
# [fs]
#   "/" = "static" # Map static files

# [package.metadata.wasmer]
# runtime = "node" # Hypothetical way to specify runtime
# entrypoint = "index.js"
